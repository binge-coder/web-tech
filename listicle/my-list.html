    <h1>Dark mode ? really bro?</h1>
    <p>Yes I do. That's what I say when I am professing my love to dark mode.</p>
    <p>One of the main benefits of dark mode is that it is easier on the eyes. Bright white backgrounds can be harsh, especially in low light conditions, and can cause eye strain and headaches. Dark mode, on the other hand, reduces the amount of light emitted by the screen, making it more comfortable to view for longer periods of time.</p>
    <p>Another advantage of dark mode is that it can save battery life, especially on devices with OLED or AMOLED screens. In these types of displays, each pixel is individually lit, and black pixels are essentially turned off, which can significantly reduce power consumption. This can be especially useful for mobile devices, where battery life is often a concern.</p>
    <p>But beyond its practical benefits, I simply love the look of dark mode. It gives a sleek and modern look to apps and websites, and can even improve the contrast and readability of text. Plus, as someone who spends a lot of time in front of a screen, using dark mode just feels more comfortable and natural to me.</p>
